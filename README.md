# Containers-a-go-go

A playground for experimenting with [containerd][1] and [Go][2].

## Prerequisites

You should have a running `containerd` daemon and a `go` executable
available on your PATH.

While not strictly necessary, I highly recommend using [asdf][3]
to manage the tools you use in your local development environment.
It's unobtrusive and easy to install/uninstall, and will make your
development environments so much simpler.

## Building

Just run `make`.
